# restrained_ESP_fit

This is a fork of the `resp` program commonly used in computational chemistry for fitting partial charges to values of the provided molecular Electrostatic Potential (ESP) field around a molecule.
The method was first described by Bayly et al.¹ using the MK mesh of sampling the ESP field² but the program can generally fit charges to any mesh of points.
The mesh needs to be produced independently; see the [jszopi/repESP](https://github.com/jszopi/repESP) repo for some helpers, including extracting ESP fitting points from the output of the Gaussian program and wrapping the calls to the `resp` program in a Python library.

History prior to version 2.2 was not preserved (or rather, reconstructed, considering lack of a version controlled repo).
This version was downloaded in May 2020 from https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/RED/ together with other programs in q4md-fft tools 2.0.
The original README for this version can be found in the [`README-2.4.txt` file](https://github.com/jszopi/resp/blob/master/README-2.4.txt) — see for build instructions.
Usage instructions are only available for version 2.2 and are hosted at https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/RED/resp/ (if link is down, get your browser to display [the repo version](https://github.com/jszopi/resp/blob/566c9207b87ed37c6a8b2e47a581704db762f16c/resp-2.2.html)).
Use the `restrained_ESP_fit` script to invoke the program, as the name `resp` is now deprecated. 

I am hoping to rewrite this program in Python in order to encourage users to experiment with their own fitting methods.
The code will thus soon be available in PyPI, possibly under a less generic name.
Please open a PR if you'd like it to be available in your system's package manager.
